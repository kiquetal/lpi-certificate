# Acknowledgment

- There are many terms of and abstracted subdivision in computer software, we'll use the term **Component**.

- We arrange components into _layers_ or _levels_. A _layer_ or _level_ is a classification (or grouping) of a component according to where that component sits between the user and the hardware.

- A **Linux** system has three main levels.

## Hardware
Hardware includes the memory as well as one or more CPU to perform computation and to read from and write memory.

## Kernel
The Kernel (_runs in a kernel mode_) is software residing in memory that tell the CPU what to do. The area that only the kernel can access is called kernel space.

## Processes
_(Run in a user mode)_ The running programs that the kernel manages, called typically _user space_. For example: Web Servers.

User mode in comparission restricts access to a subset of memory. _User space_ refers to the parts of main memory that the user processes can access.

### Hardware
#### Main Memory
##### State
Strictly speaking a state is a particular arrangement of bits. In a more abstract approach: something has done or is doing at the moment. For example, "The process is waiting for input". **Because itâ€™s common to refer to the state in abstract terms rather than to the actual bits, the term image refers to a particular physical arrangement of bits.**
